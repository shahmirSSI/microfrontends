# Microfrontends

> Introduction to Microfrontends

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

- Author smaller, easier to understand codebases
- Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!
- Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users
- Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently
